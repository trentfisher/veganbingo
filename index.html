While I don't like any sort of killing, those who do it out of necessity are very different from those who have no such necessity but still enjoy the products of tortured and murdered animals just because they like the taste. In other words, there is a world of difference between an Inuit killing and eating a bear and an American picking up a plastic wrapped steak at the grocery store.

Furthermore, the number of deaths caused by hunter-gatherer societies is insignificant compared to that which we cause, therefore isn't of a lot of concern to me.

	</div>
	<div class="answer">
	  There are two problems here. First is that fossil fuel (coal, oil, natural gas) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel#Origin">came from algae, plankton and plants.</a> Secondly, even if fossil fuel did come from dinosaurs, as the myth goes, they were able to live out their natural lives without being enslaved or killed by humans.
	  <br/>
	  Of course, we should not be using fossil fuels in the irresponsible way we are, but that's simply a matter of common sense, not animal rights.

      further searching revealed it originated
      <a href="http://www.postpunkkitchen.com/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=2053258#p2053087">here</a>.  Someone did a <a href="http://www.easyvegan.info/2009/12/15/defensive-omnivore-bingo-2/">second version</a>.
      I've added some new entries taken from various places around the, uh, internets and my own experience.
